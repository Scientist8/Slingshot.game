# Slingshot.game
 A slingshot mechanic game where you drag and shoot a bald man.
 
 Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well.
 
 This is the first time I've worked on Unity's Universal Render Pipeline project. I have learnt a lot of new concepts.
 
 It is the second case study the game company I applied for internship sent.
 
 Tried to make a slingshot mechanic where you tap, drag and release to shoot a character to a target.
 
 Used line renderer for sling.
 
 I've tried to make trajectory projection where the player could see the shoot trajectory. 
 For this I have tried to implement the physics formula for finding the trajectory of a projectile.
 However as one can see in the example, it didn't worked as I wanted to. Something definitely went wrong for trajectory projection.
 
 Also I have tried to implement Cinemachine for camera changes, but couldn't quite figure out how to follow an instantiated object.
 So I removed it later, because I was running out of time.
 
 I had to put it on as it is, because I am running out of time.
 I will definitely be working on this project later on and try to make it better.
